<h1>THE ANSWER</h1>

<h2>By Emil Petaja</h2>

<p>He had strangled Lisa many times in his<br />
dreams. But always, as she died, the phone rang.<br />
Did he dare to pick it up and answer the call?...</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The room was dark. It was always dark, so dark he couldn't see the
bed, the soft wide bed with the plum satin headpiece that was studded
with cushioned buttons, and the triangle of chiffon that was draped
elegantly from the ceiling. The Venetian blinds were shut tight, so
that not even the blackness of the black summer's night could be seen.</p>

<p>John Reeve couldn't see the bed, and he also couldn't see his tall self
in the modern half-moon mirror of his wife's dressing table across from
him. Most of all he couldn't see her&mdash;Lisa, his wife.</p>

<p>But he could hear and smell. He could hear Lisa breathing softly. He
could scent her intoxicating perfume which clung to the hot windless
air of the room. Then there was the uneven pounding of his own
heart&mdash;that told him he <i>was</i> here, here in his wife's apartment.</p>

<p>It was so late. It was that dark hour when the planets themselves
sleep, couched against their black bed of space. It was that dark hour
when illusion takes hold and reality wavers in the balance.</p>

<p>Standing there, John Reeve forgot. He forgot&mdash;everything. Who he
was, where he had come from, what he was doing here in Lisa's uptown
apartment. He didn't belong here. Lisa didn't belong to him any more.
It was over. She belonged to&mdash;</p>

<p>Why? Why had she left him?</p>

<p>He couldn't remember. He tried, but he couldn't remember. He couldn't
even remember how he got in here. Had he stolen a key? Bribed the
red-head at the desk downstairs?</p>

<p>He couldn't even remember two minutes ago.</p>

<p>He stood there in the hot windless dark, listening to Lisa's soft
breathing, listening to the uneven rhythm of his heart. He sucked
in the heady perfume that he had reason to remember so well. He did
remember <i>that</i>. He saw rows of little bottles, lavender bottles, oddly
shaped bottles. Anniversaries. Birthdays. No special days. What was
it called? Tigress? Musetta? Jealousy? Maybe. Maybe that was it. He
couldn't remember concreteness, only things you <i>feel</i> more than you
think about.</p>

<p>Why didn't Lisa ever open her window at night? Such a hot summer's
night as this?</p>

<p>He curved a little smile into the perfumed dark. Lisa had always been
like that. Always. No fresh air fiend Lisa. Lisa shrank from draughts
as from dragons. She always kept her windows shut tight at night. They
had quarrelled about that&mdash;too. Lisa loved warmth. She was like a
kitten snuggling cosily in front of the fire, a lissome tawny-haired
kitten.</p>

<p>And now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John Reeve sighed. Because now he remembered the one important thing he
had to remember. He remembered why he had come here, to Lisa's uptown
apartment, now in the darkest corner of the hot summer's night. All
in a rush it came to him, a rush of tremulous feeling. There was no
thought behind it. It was pure feeling. He didn't stop to analyze the
wherefores to any degree, or to catalog them neatly in the pigeonholes
of his brain. He just knew what he had to do and he did it.</p>

<p>He walked over to the bed and strangled Lisa.</p>

<p>It wasn't bad, but the long moment afterwards was.</p>

<p>The room was just the same. The windless heat, the jealous scent of
Lisa's perfume mingled with the scent of her tawny unseen hair. His
hands saw it though, blindly, so soft and silky under them. Lisa was so
still, she died so gently.</p>

<p>The silence, while he hung there over Lisa, barely touching her hair,
held as in a cup all the ache and the agony a man can endure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt=""/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p>As his fingers tightened he heard the insistent ringing of Lisa's telephone....</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Then the telephone started to ring.</p>

<p>He didn't look at it. This sudden sound, shattering the cup of silence,
made him shudder.</p>

<p>It rang and rang.</p>

<p><i>Answer it.</i></p>

<p>It was a prickling voice in his mind. No, it wasn't. It was a tiny
ghost that had hidden in the curve of his ear and was whispering into
his ear's cavern, then shouting merrily against the membrane of his
eardrum:</p>

<p><i>Answer it!</i></p>

<p>It was Lisa. He recognized her voice.</p>

<p>He pulled up sharply, tossing a heavy breath across the bed.</p>

<p>Lisa, you fool! If I answer it, then they'll know I was here. They'll
say I killed you and they'll strap me down in a chair and send
ten-million volts of electricity through me and I'll be as dead as you
are.</p>

<p>The voice changed now. It wheedled, it caressed, it coaxed him. It
made a joke out of it. Then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Please answer the telephone, darling. You know I can't stand to leave
it ring like that. It's somehow&mdash;sacrilegious. Please, darling.</i></p>

<p>It was true. If Lisa were alive she wouldn't leave her telephone
ringing like that, never. That was one thing Lisa was meticulous,
even fetishistic, about. She might not be so meticulous about other
things, such as husbands, but she invariably flew to the telephone
when it rang. She used to lie on her silken bed and talk to it for
hours, caressing it with her long red-tipped fingers. Lisa had loved
the telephone. She had loved it above everything else. Maybe more than
John. What do you mean, maybe? Of course she loved it more than she
loved John!</p>

<p>He didn't move, so the ghost in his ear began to taunt him.</p>

<p><i>You always used to want to know who was calling me, John. You used to
insist on knowing. You used to try to beat me to the telephone. Well,
now's your chance</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>John Reeve stiffened. That was true, too. All too humiliatingly true.
He made a rough noise in his throat, then brushed a hand across the
darkness. He located the telephone by its impudent burring. He reached
for it&mdash;and almost had it.</p>

<p>Then he woke up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course it was only a dream. Of course! He hadn't really killed Lisa.
It was only this dream he kept on having over and over and over. A man
could go out of his mind&mdash;</p>

<p>And always the same. That was why he couldn't remember going to Lisa's
apartment, or getting in, or anything like that. Just being there,
feeling the oppressive summer heat, the dark silence, scenting Lisa's
jealous perfume, wondering why she never opened a window, and then
strangling Lisa.</p>

<p>But the telephone was the worst thing.</p>

<p>He didn't like to strangle Lisa, it was definitely not the act of
a gentleman, and John Reeve considered himself a gentleman. He was
never crude, at least. When Lisa said casually one night after dinner.
"Darling, I'm leaving you," he didn't exactly yawn but put something of
the effect of a yawn into his smile. "Are you, dear?" He was too much
of a gentleman to try to hold her if she wanted to go, even for one day.</p>

<p>But it hurt. It had clawed his heart all that night, and the next, and
all the next nights until&mdash;</p>

<p>Of all the things that tortured him in his dream, the telephone was by
far the worst. Why, why, why did the dream have to end just there? It
was just as Lisa, or Lisa's ghost in the dream, said. He was curious.
He had to know. It was driving him crazy not to know. Once he thought
that by straining at the dream and forcing it to go on, his fingers
did actually contact the cold surface of the telephone. But he wasn't
sure. He wasn't sure.</p>

<p>More and more the dream obsessed him. Like a succubus it drained him,
and pummelled him, and lay heavily on him. He did other things; his
existence must have included innumerable other things such as eating,
brushing his teeth, bathing, working. Working, of course. Working at
what? Sometimes he thought vaguely that it had to do with fuel. But
what did that matter? The dream was the only thing that mattered! It
was the important factor in his miserable existence!</p>

<p>Always the same. Always the telephone ringing, just after he strangled
Lisa. Always the little ghost in his ear. He tried to reach the
telephone. He strained hard, but he never could, not quite. It was the
damndest thing.</p>

<p>Oh, it must have been eons, at least, before the dream began to edge
in his favor. Perceptibly, the dream began to last longer. Each time
he fought to keep the dream going. That was the only way he would ever
know. The conclusion of the dream lay in his actually picking up that
telephone and finding out who was calling. He had to know.</p>

<p>Lisa's ghost pleaded and begged him to answer it. Her telephone mania
in life had extended itself beyond the grave. She had to know, too.</p>

<p><i>Answer it, darling. You always have to know everything....</i></p>

<p>No, damn you! He fought her, at first. Then they'll know I was here!
They'll pin your murder on me! They'll strap me in a chair and&mdash;</p>

<p>All the same, he knew he had to answer that telephone, no matter what
happened. Lisa had always teased him about his curiosity in the matters
of her many telephone calls. It was the not-knowing that was sheer
torture&mdash;</p>

<p>Finally it came.</p>

<p>Finally.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The room was quite dark, it was always dark. He couldn't see the bed,
the soft wide bed with the plum satin headpiece that was studded
with cushioned buttons, and the triangle of chiffon that was draped
elegantly from the ceiling. The venetian blinds were shut tight, the
summer heat was stifling, it was like an impenetrable wall.</p>

<p>But he could hear and smell. He could hear Lisa breathing softly. He
could scent the madness of her perfume. He couldn't remember how he
came here, now in the night's darkest corner.</p>

<p>Why doesn't Lisa ever open her window? Such a hot summer's night.</p>

<p>Lisa. Warm, cosy little Lisa. Like a tawny kitten curled up by the
fire. She could never stand a single breath of cold air. Maybe that was
why. Maybe some of his words were breaths of cold air. In the beginning
everything had been so warm and cosy. Then&mdash;coolness, coldness. Why
weren't you here when I telephoned today? You're always so careful to
answer the telephone. Why not <i>me</i>? Who was the man that called you on
the telephone while you were out? Not your hairdresser! Not again!</p>

<p>Then Lisa went away.</p>

<p>John Reeve curved a smile into the darkness and walked to the bed and
strangled Lisa.</p>

<p>Then the long silence before the telephone rang. It was so hot. His
forehead was sticky. So frightfully hot here, without a single open
window.</p>

<p><i>Brrrrr.</i></p>

<p><i>Answer it. Answer it, darling!</i></p>

<p>Why was Lisa so anxious, perched there on his earlobe? Why? Only
because she'd always been fanatical about answering telephones while
she was alive and that now, dead, she clung to her fetish. Or&mdash;was it
to tantalize him into making his presence here in her apartment at the
time of her death known, so that the police&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Answer it. Answer it, darling!</i></p>

<p>He reached for it in the darkness. This time he strained harder than
ever. This time he reached it. He had to. He had to know. No matter
what happened he had to know. It was driving him crazy. Surely such a
torture must have an end.</p>

<p>He made it. His hand grasped the telephone and held on to it grimly. He
put it to his ear in triumph.</p>

<p>"Hello?" he told it. "Hello!"</p>

<p>Silence. The room was a cup of black silence.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he shouted. "Who is this? Tell me who this is!"</p>

<p>There was a low wisp of laughter. It might have been the instrument, or
it might have come from Lisa's tiny ghost, still perched on his earlobe.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Central office," answered a voice like the largest pipe in a church
organ. "Satan speaking."</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
